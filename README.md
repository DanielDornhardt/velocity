Velocity
========
A reactive test-runner for Meteor.

**PLEASE NOTE: This is very early sneak-preview and is under heavy development.**

To run, type:

```
cd example
mrt
```

You'll see the leaderboard example started on port 3000.

You'll also see a green dot in the top right. If any tests are failing, this will go red. Clicking the dot will show you the reports.

Try to modify the tests and watch the tests update reactively in the browser.
